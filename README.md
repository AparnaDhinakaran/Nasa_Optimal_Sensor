Nasa_Optimal_Sensor
===================

Berkeley Energy Sustainable Technologies Research Project

Please refer to Project Description for an understanding of this project. 
Note: This is a project presentation given at the Max Tech and Beyond Appliance Design Competition. 
Our product from this research will be named inSense.


Uploaded in this repository on the files Ihave worked on and used with the sensors. 
I am part of the software group and I build and maintain the database for this project.

Many of the files in this project have been written by other older researchers but have been included in this
respository because I have employed them in my area of this research. I particularly have written the Database, 
DatabaseLight, DatabaseCloud, create_tables, and Database related files.
